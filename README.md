This repository contains MATSim simulations and their results, as part of a research project made between September 2020 and February 2021.

## Files

Explanation of directories created for the research project:

- `scripts/`: Python scripts for generating and executing scenarios to be simulated.
- `scenario1/`: A set of generated scenarios based on a virtual road network.
- `scenario2/`: A set of generated scenarios based on an actual road network from Mannyeon-dongSeo-gu, Daejeon.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages used for developing and executing the scripts.

All other files (except `pyproject.toml` and `.gitignore`) are from the [12.x release](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/releases/tag/matsim-12.0) of [MATSim](https://matsim.org/) and were _not_ created by us.
